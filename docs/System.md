# System

Mcube kernel is an operating system supporting dynamically switchable
kernels.
Mcube kernel can standardize OS for autonomous edge devices, in order
to reduce development cost and specialize the performance to guarantee
resource constraints.
Mcube kernel becomes a de facto standard OS for autonomous edge
devices and contributes to practical realization of autonomous
systems.
