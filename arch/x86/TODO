* Let our ``kthread_create(void (*x)())'' interface, which creates a
  new kernel thread running the method `x()', accept a function taking
  a void parameter instead.

  Why? Too often we need to pass certain values to new threads, but so
  far we were not able to do so. This also makes us one step closer
  to the Posix pthread_create() interface.

  (The functionality is not so quick to do as it seems: we'll need to
   modify the new thread's emulated IRQ stack frame to achieve it)
