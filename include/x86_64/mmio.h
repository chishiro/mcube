/*
 * Memory-mapped I/O registers accessors
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2009 Ahmed S. Darwish <darwish.07@gmail.com>
 *
 * Originally, the 'volatile' keyword was meant for memory-mapped I/O,
 * but this keyword is one of the very vague parts of ANSI C, and it
 * seems no compiler is able to get them completely right.[1][2]
 *
 * We force our own interpretation of volatile, where we explicitly use
 * compiler barriers which will cause GCC not to keep memory values
 * cached in registers across the assembler instruction and not optimize
 * stores or loads to that memory. We also use the mov instruction under
 * "asm volatile" where gcc won't optimize it away.
 *
 * GCC manual notes that "even a volatile asm instruction can be moved
 * relative to other code, including across jump instructions". Thus, we
 * explicitly inform GCC about the memory addresses read from and written
 * to (in the constraints), so it does not reorder data-dependent ops.
 *
 * Constraints are volatile-casted to assert safety of passing a pointer
 * to volatile memory in those accessors, and as a second marker to GCC
 * not to let it cache the result in regs (a conformant compiler does not
 * cache a volatile memory value in regs). For other interesting details
 * on GCC optimizations, see our percpu_get()/set() comments @ 'percpu.h'.
 *
 * Finally, using those accessors won't clutter the top codebase with
 * volatiles, and will make it explicit we're accessing MMIO.

 * of the Eighth ACM and IEEE International Conference.
