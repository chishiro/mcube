/*
 * IRQ vectors assignment to bootstrap CPU
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2010-2012 Ahmed S. Darwish <darwish.07@gmail.com>
 *
 * We manually assign vector numbers to different IRQ sources till we
 * have a dynamic IRQ model.
 *
 * NOTE! The 32 vectors <= 0x1f are reserved for architecture-defined
 * exceptions and interrupts; don't use them.
 *
 * NOTE! Local & IO APICs only support vectors in range [0x10 -> 0xff].
 * "When an interrupt vector in  the range 0 to 15 is sent or received
 * through the local APIC, the APIC indicates an illegal vector in its
 * Error Status Register. Although vectors [0x10 -> 0x1f] are reserved,
 * the local APIC does not treat them as illegeal."  --Intel
 *
 * Several interrupts might be pending on a CPU instruction boundary;
 * APIC prioritize IRQs based on their IOAPIC-setup vector numbers:
 *
 *  IRQ priority = vector number / 0x10 (highest 4 bits)
 *
 * where the [0x0 -> 0xff] possible vector values lead to:
 *
 *  0x100 / 0x10 = 0x10        (16) IRQ priority classes
 *
 * with `1' being the lowest priority, and `15' being the highest.
